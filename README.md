# Stock Prediction
https://ml-stock-prediction.streamlit.app/

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Features
- Historical stock price analysis
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model development using various algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM)
- Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualization of predictions against actual prices

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- yfinance
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Keras (TensorFlow)
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory analysis)
